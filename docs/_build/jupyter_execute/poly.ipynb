The remainder of $f(x)/g(x)$ is precisely $f(\\lambda)$. This result is referred to as the *Polynomial remainder theorem*. See [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_remainder_theorem) for more details.\n",

We evaluated this by calling the `eval()` method, which in turn is coded as a direct computation. Via polynomial long division, we can calculate $f/(x - 107)$ and extract the remainder. \n",

    "\n",
    "As with integers, for two polynomials $f, g$ there is always a common divisor, namely the unit polynomial $1$. In further similarity, it is possible to find larger common divisors. Recall that a polynomial $h$ *divides* $f$ if, in the polynomial long division $f/h$, the remainder is the zero polynomial. Euclid's famous algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor for two integers can be adapted straightforwardly for finding the greatest common divisor for two univariate polynomials. \n",
    "\n",
    "We decribe the algorithm in what follows. Let $f, g$ be two univariate polynomials. Suppose that $\\deg f \\geq \\deg g$. Then the polynomial long division states that there exist polynomials $(f_1, f_2)$ such that \n",

    "with $\\deg f_2 < \\deg g$. Here $f_2$ is the remainder in the division $f/g$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, we want to find the greatest *common* divisor of $f, g$ which means a polynomial $h$ which divides both $f$ and $g$. Now, in the case $f_2 = 0$ above, the remainder of $f/g$ is zero. Hence $f = gf_1$. Since $f_1$ is polynomial, it follows that $f$ is divisible by $g$. Now, $g$ is also divisible by $g$ so therefore the greatest common divisor will be the denominator $g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case $f_2$ is *not* the zero polynomial, we need to check divisibility for $g$. Now in order for $f$ and $g$ to have a common divisor, note that it is equivalent for $g$ and $f_2$ to have a common divisor. Since $\\deg f_2 < \\deg g$ we can divide $g$ by $f_2$ to get the next relation,\n",
