    "### Zeroes of polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a rational function is a quotient of one polynomial by another. It is only defined for values at which its denominator is non-zero. Zeroes of polynomials are therefore essential in determining valid domains of definition for rational functions.  A value $x_0$ is a zero of a polynomial $f(x)$ if\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x_0) = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that evaluation coincides with remainders of polynomial division. Hence if $x_0$ is a zero of $f(x)$ this is equivalent to stating $f(x)$ is *divisible* by the polynomial $x - x_0$. That is, $f(x)$ is a multiple of $(x - x_0)$ and so is referred to as being in the \"ideal\" generated by $(x - x_0)$. The ring of remainders is $\\mathbb K[x]/(x -x_0)$ and in this ring $f(x) \\mapsto 0$, the zero polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the nature of zeroes of a polynomial, recall that polynomials are determing by their coefficients. Varying these coefficients in a suitable way should also result in varying the \"location\" of these zeroes. Above, with $x_0$ the zero of the polynomial $f(x)$, we can refer to $x_0$ as a location of a zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental theorem of algebra states that any univariate polynomial of degree $n$ has *at most* $n$ many zeroes. If, in addition, the polynomial is complex (i.e., its coefficients are complex numbers) then there will be *exactly* $n$ zeroes of the polynomial (counted with multiplicity). \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "\n",
    "Phrased in another way, one says the field of complex numbers $\\mathbb C$ is *algebraically closed*. This is contrast to the field of real numbers which are emphatically *not* algebraically closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The discriminant\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, varying the coefficients of a polynomial in some regular way ought to reveal important information on the nature of its zeroes. The process of \"varying these coefficients\" means to construct an analytic function of them. Ideally, we might hope that every instantiation of some function of a polynomial's coefficients might return a location of a zero. This is generally too much to hope for however. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet some partial information may be gleaned from the construction of the *discriminant*. For the purposes of this document it sufficies to know that the discriminant is an analytic function (in fact, a *multivariate* polynomial) of the coefficients of a polynomial. It is obtained as a multiple of the resultant of a polynomial and its derivative. For more details and further material on the discriminant see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant).\n"
