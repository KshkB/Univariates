Over the complex numbers, there will always exist three roots of $f$, counted with multiplicity. \n",

    "Recall that any cubic can be transformed into a much simpler cubic, name its depression. The problem of finding roots of the cubic can therefore be reduced to finding roots of its depression, which is significantly easier. Since we know the transformation $x \\mapsto x - \\frac{b}{3a}$ sends the original cubic $f$ to (a multiple of) its depressed form, we can therefore obtain the root of $f$ by simply translating back any root of its depressed form. More explicitly, if $x_{depr}$ is a root of the depressed form of $f$, then the translate $x_{depr} + \\frac{b}{3a}$ will be a root of $f$.\n",

    "```{note}\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that it suffices to find only one root. The others can be obtained on multiplying by an appropriate root of unity. Once we have three roots we know, by the fundamental theorem of algebra, that we have found *all* the roots. With Cardano's formula and a cube root of unity it is possible to derive all the roots of a cubic.\n",
