    "To see why matrices are relevant, recall that any complex number $z$ is specified by two real numbers $x, y$. The correspondence $z \\mapsto (x, y)$ gives an *isomorphism* of sets $\\mathbb C\\cong \\mathbb R^2$. As the complex numbers form a field we have the operation of multiplication $\\mathbb C\\times \\mathbb C \\rightarrow \\mathbb C$. Equivalently (or rather, *dually*), any complex number $z$ can be thought of via the multiplication $z : \\lambda \\mapsto \\lambda \\cdot z$. Hence any complex number is a transformation $\\mathbb C \\rightarrow \\mathbb C$. Note that it is linear since $a\\lambda \\mapsto (a\\lambda) z = a(\\lambda z)$. Hence moreover, any complex number will be a *linear transformation*. Using that $\\mathbb C\\cong \\mathbb R^2$, we deduce that any complex number can be thought of as a linear transformation $\\mathbb R^2 \\rightarrow \\mathbb R^2$, i.e., as a $2\\times 2$ matrix.\n",
